                <li>
                    After his early schooling, he joined Ravenshaw Collegiate School. From there he went to join
                    Presidency College, Calcutta and was expelled due to his nationalist activities. Later, he went to
                    University of Cambridge, U.K.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In <strong> 1919</strong>, Bose headed to <strong>London to give the Indian Civil Services</strong>
                    (ICS) examination and he was selected. Bose, however,<strong> resigned</strong> from Civil Services
                    as he believed he could not side with the British.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He was highly influenced by Vivekananda's teachings and considered him as his spiritual Guru. His
                    political mentor was Chittaranjan Das.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In 1921, Bose took over the editorship of the newspaper <strong>'Forward'</strong>, founded by

                        Congress</strong> and also the Secretary of Bengal State Congress.

                <li>
                    He was also sent to prison in Mandalay in 1925 due to his connections with revolutionary movements

                </li>
                <li>
                    During the <strong>mid-1930s</strong> Bose travelled in Europe. He researched and wrote the first
                    part of his book, The <strong> Indian Struggle</strong>, which covered the country’s independence
                    movement in the years 1920–1934.
                </li>

                        1938 (Haripur)</strong> and stood for unqualified <strong>Swaraj</strong> (self-governance) and
                    the use of force against the British which then combated against Mahatma Gandhi and his views.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bose was <strong>re-elected in 1939 (Tripuri)</strong> but soon <strong> resigned from the
                        presidency</strong> and formed the <strong>All India Forward Bloc</strong>, a faction within the
                    Congress which aimed at consolidating the political left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    He died on 18th August 1945, in a plane crash in Japanese-ruled Formosa (now Taiwan).

                    prior to their capture by Axis forces.

                    July 1943, issued from there his famous call, ‘Delhi Chalo’, and announced the formation of the
                    <strong> Azad Hind Government</strong> and the <strong> Indian National Army</strong> on 21st
                    October 1943.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The INA was first formed under <strong> Mohan Singh</strong> and Japanese Major Iwaichi
                            Fujiwara and comprised Indian prisoners of war of the British-Indian Army captured by Japan
                            in the Malayan (present-day Malaysia) campaign and at Singapore.</li>
                        <li>The INA included both, the Indian prisoners of war from Singapore and Indian civilians in

                        <li>The INA fought allied forces in 1944 inside the borders of India in Imphal and in Burma.

                        <li>However, with the fall of Rangoon, Azad Hind Government ceased to be an effective political
                            entity.</li>
                        <li>In November 1945 a British move to put the INA men on trial immediately sparked massive

                    <strong> Impact:</strong> The I.N.A. experience created the wave of disaffection in the British
                    Indian army during the 1945-46, which culminated in the great Bombay naval strike of February 1946
                    and was one of the most decisive reasons behind the British decision to make a quick withdrawal.

                    <strong> Composition of I.N.A:</strong> The I.N.A. was essentially non-communal, with Muslims quite
                    prominent among its officers and ranks, and it also introduced the innovation of a women’s
                    detachment named after the Rani of Jhansi.
